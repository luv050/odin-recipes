    <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of bread (white, wheat, sourdough, or your favorite kind)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>2-3 slices of cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, Gruyere, Swiss, or any combination you like)</li>
            <li>Optional: pinch of salt and pepper, sliced tomato, avocado, thinly sliced onion, herbs</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread one tablespoon of butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Place one slice of bread, butter-side down, in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Top with cheese and any other desired ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place the other slice of bread, butter-side up, on top of the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted.
            </li>
            <li>Cut in half and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p><h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For a richer flavor, use mayonnaise instead of butter on the outside of the bread.</li>
        <li>To prevent the bread from burning, cook over medium heat and don't press down on the sandwich too hard.</li>
        <li>If you like your cheese extra melty, you can cover the skillet with a lid while the sandwich cooks.</li>
        <li>Get creative with your ingredients! Try adding different types of cheese, meats, vegetables, or herbs.</li>
    </ul></p>
